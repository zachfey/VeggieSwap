## Description
Veggie Swap is an app that allows gardeners and veggie lovers to trade fresh produce with others in their area, no matter the variety. Users can post what they have available to swap and specify what they are looking to swap for. The available transaction is then displayed on the page for other users to accept. Once the trade is made, the transaction is logged in the past transactions section of the website. 

## Motivation
One of my group members explained that he enjoyed growing food, but he often harvested more food that he could handle. It would be great if there was an easy way to exchange excess food with other farmers in the area. Sort of like a craigslist for gardened goods.

## Results
A version of the app is complete and deployed. However, an important aspect of this application is that there should be user authentication. The current version allows anybody to accept or mark trades as complete because authentication has not yet been implemented. However, the API with the SQL database is in place, and the bones of the app are completed.

## Work Load
I was responsible for the back-end code and the calls to the database. I also assisted the front-end team with using our templating framework, Handlebars. The job of handling authentication was given to another group member, but she was not responsive and did not complete that portion.

## Challenges
I think the biggest challenge with this project was coordinating the team. When we realized that one group member may not be able to finish their assign portion, we should have been ready to step in and help it get done.

## Improvements
The app needs authentication to be completed. Also, we would like to track past exchanges to let users know the average going rate for specific trades, i.e. 1 apple is usually traded for 10 blueberries.

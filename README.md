Veggie Swap is an app that allows gardeners and veggie lovers to trade fresh produce with others in their area, no matter the variety. Users can post what they have available to swap and specify what they are looking to swap for. The available transaction is then displayed on the page for other users to accept. Once the trade is made, the transaction is logged in the past transactions section of the website.
